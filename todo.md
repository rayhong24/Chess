# TODO
- Make test errors clearer
- Implement coords class
- Implement the interface (following UCI)
- 50 move rule and turn counter
    - Like from fenstr
- Refactor castling
- Change board check in testGameClass 
    - either change formatting or implementation
- Change stored coords of a piece to use file and row
    - i.e. row=6, col=4 becomes file=e, rank=2
- Fix fenstring castling rights check for tests
    - Fix fenstring "-" for castling rights
- Create a Piece factory so logic is not part of the Board class.
