# TODO
- Game rule to implement:
    - enpassant
    - 50 move rule 
    - turn counter
    - timer
    - 3-fold repetition
    - stalemate
- Make code faster/ more efficient:
    - Code vital parts in a a faster language (C/C++ or Rust)
    - Change move implementation to remove redundant operations
- Improve heuristic
    - Hard coded position values
        - For example, pieces like knights are generally better closer to the center because they have more possible squares to move to.

- Support more advanced UCI command:
    - ponder - thinking during the opponents turn
    - supporting multiple games

- Creating a testsuite
