# TODO
- Add a public check_valid_move method in the Move class.
    - Currently, move checking when using the interface iterates through all possible moves from the player and checking if the inputted move is in that set.
        - Inefficient and unneeded
- Change implementation of checking for check. Does a similar thing as the check_valid_move at the moment.
- Remove get_representation() method from piece class. Use built-in repr or str methods instead.
- Implement the interface (following UCI)
- Make test errors clearer
- 50 move rule and turn counter
    - Like from fenstr
- Refactor castling
- Change board check in testGameClass 
    - either change formatting or implementation
- Change stored coords of a piece to use file and row
    - i.e. row=6, col=4 becomes file=e, rank=2
- Fix fenstring castling rights check for tests
    - Fix fenstring "-" for castling rights
- Create a Piece factory so logic is not part of the Board class.
