# Fairy Penguin - Custom Chess Engine
One random evening many years ago, I was playing chess in the living room with my family. None of us were very good, and I remember throwing away a completely winning position. What followed was a slight obsession with the game where I proceeded to spend most of my free time playing online. Eventually, this led to me starting the high school chess club, and on occasion, having me participate in local tournaments.

After entering university to study computer science, I thought creating my own custom chess engine would be a great project to combine my interests. Not only would I be able to apply what I learned during my studies and deepen my understanding about them, but also learn new concepts in computer science.

This is what inspired me to start the development of Fairy Penguin. I started this at some point during university and have been gradually iterating on it between semesters or during my free time. Although I will be graduating from university soon, I do not plan on stopping development of Fairy Penguin. Like I said earlier, this is a passion project that I am using to apply my knowledge and to learn. There is a near endless list of features and improvements I would like to implement and plan on doing so, however gradually that is. 

I have created a bot account on Lichess that I generally use to test the engine. You can follow Fairy Penguin [here](https://lichess.org/@/FairyPenguin). Feel free to check out its game history or challenge it to a game if I have it online and connected.

## Features
- Implements the [Universal Chess Interface (UCI)](https://www.shredderchess.com/chess-features/uci-universal-chess-interface.html) so it can communicate with external GUI applications.
- Engine "thinking" is done with a minimax algorithm (with alpha-beta pruning) along with a custom board-evaluation heuristic

## Lessons Learned
I started this project with a passion in
